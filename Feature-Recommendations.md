## Feature Enhancement and Premium Feature Recommendations

### Purpose
This document provides concise, high‑leverage ideas to enhance existing features, add new capabilities, and define premium tiers for most SaaS/mobile/web products. Select items that map to your users’ core jobs‑to‑be‑done.

### Enhance existing features (advanced add-ons)
- **Saved views & filters**: Persistent filters, shareable links, pin defaults per role.
- **Bulk actions & automation**: Multi-select plus rules (if/then triggers) to reduce repetitive work.
- **Templates & presets**: Curated templates, one‑click setup, role‑based defaults.
- **Inline analytics**: Key metrics inside workflows (sparklines, trends, deltas, SLAs).
- **Smart suggestions**: AI‑assisted drafts, autocomplete, next‑best‑action hints.
- **Collaboration upgrades**: Comments with mentions, tasks, resolutions, version history, presence.
- **Keyboard‑first UX**: Global command palette, shortcuts, fuzzy search across entities.
- **Performance & reliability**: Offline mode, optimistic updates, retry queues, partial loading.
- **Personalization**: User‑level preferences, feature toggles, custom fields, branding.
- **Integrations**: Bidirectional sync with key tools; import/export; webhooks.

### New features (core value expansion)
- **Workflow builder**: Visual pipelines with triggers, conditions, and actions.
- **Reporting studio**: Custom dashboards, cohort filters, scheduled reports, drill‑downs.
- **Marketplace**: Extensions/apps from partners to drive add‑on revenue and stickiness.
- **Data enrichment**: Auto‑augment records (company, contact, product metadata).
- **Roles & permissions**: Fine‑grained RBAC, approval flows, audit trail.
- **API platform**: Public API, SDKs, webhook management, OAuth apps.
- **Mobile companion**: Quick capture, push actions, offline tasks.
- **Quality/guardrails**: Policy checks, anomaly detection, rollback/undo.

### Premium features (tiering ideas)
- **Security & compliance**: SSO/SAML, SCIM, audit logs, data residency, custom DPA.
- **Scale & performance**: Higher limits, concurrency, priority queues, faster SLAs.
- **Advanced analytics**: Attribution, forecasting, cohort retention, LTV models.
- **Automation at scale**: More runs, scheduled jobs, multi‑step branching, human‑in‑loop.
- **Customization**: White‑label, custom domains, theming, custom objects/fields.
- **Admin controls**: Org‑wide policies, approval gates, change management tools.
- **AI power‑ups**: Premium model choices, fine‑tuning, private embeddings, retrieval.
- **Support**: Dedicated CSM, priority support, implementation services, training.

### AI‑specific upgrades (horizontal)
- **Assist everywhere**: Context‑aware actions, explain/transform, summarize threads.
- **Generate & validate**: Drafts with confidence scores, auto tests/QA, guardrail policies.
- **Search & retrieval**: Hybrid search over user data, semantic filters, grounding citations.
- **Insights**: Trend detection, anomaly alerts, root‑cause narratives.

### Packaging and monetization
- **Good/Better/Best**: Core value in Basic, team features in Pro, compliance/scale in Enterprise.
- **Usage‑based add‑ons**: Automation runs, API calls, storage/records, seats with caps.
- **Feature gating**: Release advanced components behind toggles; run pricing experiments (A/B).
- **Customer segments**: Role‑based bundles (Ops, Finance, Sales) with relevant presets.

### Validation quick wins
- **Instrument usage**: Track feature adoption, time‑to‑value, drop‑offs.
- **Run betas**: Private preview with feedback loops and in‑app surveys.
- **Measure ROI**: Time saved, error reduction, revenue impact; convert to case studies.

### Fast‑start tiering matrix (example)
| Area | Basic | Pro | Enterprise |
|---|---|---|---|
| Security | 2FA | SSO | SAML, SCIM, Audit logs, DLP |
| Automation | Manual rules | Scheduled flows | Multi‑branch, human‑in‑loop, SLA |
| Analytics | Built‑in charts | Custom dashboards | Forecasting, attribution, LTV |
| Customization | User prefs | Theming | White‑label, custom objects |
| Support | Community | Standard | Priority, CSM, onboarding |

### How to use this document
1) Identify top 2–3 user jobs‑to‑be‑done. 2) Select 4–6 items that reduce time‑to‑value for those jobs. 3) Place advanced capabilities into Pro/Enterprise. 4) Instrument, A/B price tests, iterate.

### Tailoring note
Share your product domain and target users to convert this into a concrete roadmap with example UI flows, success metrics, and pricing.
